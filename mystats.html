    <h3>Pani puri</h3>
    <p>This popular street food doesn’t need any introduction! 
    Potato, onion, chickpeas, coriander chutney stuffed crispy puri drenched in sour and spicy mint flavored water (pudina pani) easily fills one’s mouth and takes taste buds on a journey of heaven and it is no wonder that it’s a popular street snack along the length and breadth of India and known as gol gappa, puchka, pakodi, Pani Puri, etc.
